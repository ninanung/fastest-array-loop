# What do you think the fastest way to loop array is?  

There's few ways to loop array, Like for, forEach or map. But, i have never thought about what is the best?  
I will do a simple test for checking speed.  

1. Make one array that have 10000(or more) elements of string.
2. Check time how fast each method finish the array loop.
3. Compare all records.

Simple but good to know.
